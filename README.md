# 📦 Supplier

An [InfiniteChests](https://github.com/MarioFoli/InfiniteChestsV3) successor. 
We do things better, faster, and easier. Supplier allows admins to create infinite chests which restock their items instantly. Simply create a chest, put your items in and use /infchest add. Boom! You're done :)


## ⚠️ Dependencies:

Supplier releases are already bundled with all of the dependencies required **HOWEVER, an active & working MongoDB is required for Auxiliary to function properly,** which Supplier depends on.
- CSF.Net.TShock
- Auxiliary
